### 389\. Find the Difference

Given two strings *s* and *t* which consist of only lowercase letters.

String *t* is generated by random shuffling string *s* and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in *t*.

Example:

    Input:
    s = "abcd"
    t = "abcde"

    Output:
    e

    Explanation:
    'e' is the letter that was added.

### 题意
字符串s，打乱顺序后再随机插入一个字符组成t。找出插入的那个字符

### 方法（一）
只要把两个字符串连在一起看就能看出来，除了新插入的字符只出现一次，其他字符都出现两次。可以用异或运算来找出单独的一个。解法和136类似
